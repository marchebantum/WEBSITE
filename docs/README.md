# Documentation Directory

This directory contains all documentation, development history, backups, and reports.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `optimization/`
Contains optimization analysis and status reports:
- `ADDITIONAL_OPTIMIZATIONS.md` - Additional optimization notes
- `OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed optimization analysis
- `OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md` - Current optimization status

### `development/`
Contains development history, backups, and reports:

#### `backups/`
**⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are OLD versions, NOT the optimal version!**
- `Base Code V1.html` - Original base code
- `Base Code V1-v1.html` - Version 1 variant
- `Base Code V1-v2.html` - Version 2 variant
- `index-v2-backup.html` - Backup of index v2
- `index-v3-refactored.html` - Refactored index v3

**Do NOT use these for deployment. The optimal version is `index.html` in the root directory.**

#### `image-backups/`
Backup copies of images before optimization. Not used in production.

#### `unused-images/`
Images that were considered but not used in the final production version.

#### Development Reports
Various development reports documenting the project history:
- `ACTUAL_DIFFERENCES_REPORT.md`
- `ANIMATION_INVENTORY.md`
- `COMPLETE_DIFF_REPORT.md`
- `CRITICAL_MISSING_CONTENT_REPORT.md`
- `IMAGE_PATH_FIX_REPORT.md`
- `PATH_FIX_REPORT.md`
- `PHASE1_BACKUP_REPORT.md`
- `PHASE2_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`
- `PHASE3A_*.md` - Phase 3A reports
- `REFACTORING_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- `REVERSION_COMPLETE.md`

## 🎯 Quick Reference

**For deployment:** Use files in the **root directory** (`/`), NOT files in `docs/`

**For reference:** Browse files in `docs/` to understand development history

**For restoring:** Use git tags (`optimal-backup`, `optimal-v1.0`, etc.) - see main README.md
